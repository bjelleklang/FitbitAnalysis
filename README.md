This is a simple tool to analyze data dumps from Fitbit devices, although it has only been tested on the Charge HR. 
To obtain dumps, please use a tool such as Galileo (https://bitbucket.org/benallard/galileo). 

The analysis contains parts of the dump for easy comparison of headers, various IDs and so on.
